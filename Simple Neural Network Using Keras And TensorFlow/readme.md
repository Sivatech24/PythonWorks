# Simple Neural Network Using Keras And TensorFlow

A simple neural network using Keras and TensorFlow to classify the MNIST dataset (handwritten digits 0-9). It includes a basic feedforward neural network with one hidden layer.

This code defines a simple feedforward neural network using Keras and TensorFlow, trains it on the MNIST dataset, and evaluates its performance. Let me know if you need modifications or explanations! ðŸš€

neural network to include multiple hidden layers with 256, 128, and 64 neurons. Let me know if you need further modifications! ðŸš€

added code to save the trained model as "mnist_model.h5". Let me know if you need any further modifications! ðŸš€
